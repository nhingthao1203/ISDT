# Information Systems Analysis, Design, and Development

## Course Overview

This course focuses on reinforcing and developing skills in the analysis, design, and development of information systems. we will engage in comprehensive approaches to analyze, design, and deploy information systems using modern tools such as Power Designer. Additionally, the course emphasizes the skills necessary for analyzing and designing relational databases using SQL for querying data.

We will also explore various concepts in software technology and the software production process, particularly in software analysis, design, and construction.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, we will be able to:

- **Analyze Information Systems**: Use modern tools to perform a thorough analysis of information systems.
- **Design Information Systems**: Develop design solutions for information systems, incorporating contemporary methodologies and tools.
- **Develop Information Systems**: Implement information systems based on detailed analysis and design.
- **Relational Database Design**: Analyze and design relational databases based on an entity model using SQL for data querying.
- **Software Technology and Production**: Understand and present concepts related to software technology and the software production process, focusing on analysis, design, and construction.
